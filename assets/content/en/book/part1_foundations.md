# Part I — Foundations: God, Faith, Life, Death, Afterlife

## God and the Human Covenant
Islam teaches that every human is born upon fiṭra—an innate readiness to recognize God. The Qur’an speaks of the Primordial Covenant when souls testified, “Am I not your Lord?” and answered, “Yes” (Q 7:172). Religion (dīn) is a complete way of life, weaving worship, ethics, and social responsibility. God’s Names—al-Raḥmān, al-ʿAdl, al-Ḥayy—inspire mercy, justice, and stewardship.

> ACADEMIC SIDEBAR: Scholars interpret fiṭra as both innate disposition and divine guidance; see [Nasr 2015] and [Rahman 1980].

### Key Lessons
- You carry fiṭra, an inner compass toward God (Q 30:30).
- Prophets renew the covenant with clarity and compassion.
- Worship encompasses prayer, truthfulness, generosity, and service.

## Faith (Īmān), Practice (Islām), Excellence (Iḥsān)
Hadith Jibrīl outlines the pillars of faith, practice, and spiritual excellence. Faith lives in the heart, practice orders daily life, and excellence calls believers to worship as if seeing God.
