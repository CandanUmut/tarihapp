# Part II — The Prophetic Story

## From Âdem to Nûḥ
The narrative begins with creation, the teaching of names, and the moral test of free will. Nûḥ’s steadfast call to tawḥīd models perseverance under mockery.

## Ibrâhîm’s Line
Ibrâhîm, Sarah, and Hajar embody trust and migration for God. The Kaʿbah becomes a sanctuary for all peoples, linking prophetic families across time.

> ACADEMIC SIDEBAR: Comparative studies note parallels with Genesis while highlighting Qur’anic corrections.

## Mûsâ and Banî Isrâʾîl
Liberation from Pharaoh, revelation of the Torah, and the challenges of covenantal fidelity illustrate the struggle for justice.
